## Logs

We strongly recommend storing logs in one centralized place when working in a clustered environment.
MongooseIM uses Lager - the logging framework.
Its backend can be easily replaced; the `syslog` backend is included by default in MongooseIM.


### Using syslog

To activate the syslog backend you have to edit `rel/files/app.config` and uncomment the line:

    %% use below line to add syslog backend for Lager
    %        {lager_syslog_backend, [ "mongooseim", local0, info]},

Remember to provide a parameter list to make your lager syslog backend running:

* The first parameter is a string to tag all the syslog messages with.
 The default is `mongooseim`.
* The second one is the facility to log to (see the syslog documentation).
* The last parameter is the lager level at which the backend accepts messages.
 In our case it's `info`.

Depending on the system platform you use, remember also to add the appropriate line in the syslog config file:

    local0.info                     /var/log/mongooseim.log

Now all the logs of level `info` will be passed to the `/var/log/mongooseim.log` file.

Example log (e.g `tail -f /var/log/mongooseim.log`):

    Apr  1 12:36:49 User.local mongooseim[6068]: [info] <0.7.0> Application mnesia started on node mongooseim@localhost

### Further / multiserver integration

For more advanced processing and analysis of logs, including gathering logs from multiple machines, you can use one of the many available systems (e.g. logstash/elasticsearch/kibana, graylog, splunk), which collect data from the syslog and are beyond the scope of this documentation.

## Monitoring

### WombatOAM

WombatOAM is an operations and maintenance framework for Erlang based systems.
Its Web Dashboard displays this data in an aggregated manner.
Additionally, WombatOAM provides interfaces to feed the data to other OAM tools such as Graphite, Nagios or Zabbix.

For more information see: [WombatOAM](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/products/wombat-oam.html).

### graphite-collectd

To monitor MongooseIM during load testing, we recommend the following open source applications:

- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is used for data presentation.
- [Graphite](http://graphiteapp.org/) is a server used for metrics storage.
- [collectd](http://collectd.org/) is a daemon running on the monitored nodes capturing data related to CPU and Memory usage, IO etc.

### Plug-in Exometer reporters

MongooseIM uses [a fork of Exometer library](https://github.com/esl/exometer_core) for collecting metrics.
Exometer has many plug-in reporters that can send metrics to external services. We maintain [exometer_report_graphite](https://github.com/esl/exometer_report_graphite) and [exometer_report_statsd](https://github.com/esl/exometer_report_statsd) for Graphite and StatsD respectively.
It is possible to enable them in MoongooseIM via the `app.config` file.
The file sits next to the `ejabberd.cfg` file in the `rel/files` and `_REL_DIR_/etc` directories.

Below you can find a sample configuration.
It shows setting up a reporter connecting to graphite running on localhost.

You can see an additional option not listed in the Exometer docs - `mongooseim_report_interval`, which sets the metrics' resolution, i.e. how often Exometer gathers and sends metrics through reporters.
By default, the resolution is set to 60 seconds.

```erl
...
{exometer_core, [
    {mongooseim_report_interval, 60000}, %% 60 seconds
    {report, [
        {reporters, [
                     {exometer_report_graphite, [
                                                 {prefix, "mongooseim"},
                                                 {connect_timeout, 5000},
                                                 {host, "127.0.0.1"},
                                                 {port, 2003},
                                                 {api_key, ""}
                                                ]}
                    ]}
    ]}
  ]}
...
```

### Run Graphite & Grafana in Docker - quick start

The following commands will download the latest version of `kamon/grafana_graphite` docker image that contains both Grafana and Graphite, and start them while mounting local directory `./docker-grafana-graphite-master/data` for metrics persistance:

    $ curl -SL https://github.com/kamon-io/docker-grafana-graphite/archive/master.tar.gz | tar -xzf -
    $ make -C docker-grafana-graphite-master up

Go to http://localhost to view Grafana dashboard that's already set up to use metrics from Graphite.

### Add metrics to Grafana dashboard

We recommend a baseline of following metrics to track in your MongooseIM instance.
For time-based metrics, you can choose to display multiple calculated values for a reporting period - we recommend tracking at least `max`, `median` and `mean`.

```
Session count:                   <prefix>.global.totalSessionCount.value
XMPP messages received:          <prefix>.<domain>.xmppMessageReceived.one
XMPP messages sent:              <prefix>.<domain>.xmppMessageSent.one
Successful logins:               <prefix>.<domain>.sessionSuccessfulLogins.one
Logouts:                         <prefix>.<domain>.sessionLogouts.one
Authorization time:              <prefix>.<domain>.backends.auth.authorize.<value-type>
RDBMS "simple" query time:       <prefix>.<domain>.backends.mongoose_rdbms.query.<value-type>
RDBMS prepared query time:       <prefix>.<domain>.backends.mongoose_rdbms.execute.<value-type>
MAM lookups:                     <prefix>.<domain>.mam_lookup_messages.one
MAM archivization time:          <prefix>.<domain>.backends.mod_mam.archive.<value-type>
MAM lookup time:                 <prefix>.<domain>.backends.mod_mam.lookup.<value-type>
MAM private messages flush time: <prefix>.<domain>.mod_mam_odbc_async_pool_writer.flush_time.<value-type>
MAM MUC messages flush time:     <prefix>.<domain>.mod_mam_muc_odbc_async_pool_writer.flush_time.<value-type>
```

Note that RDBMS metrics are only relevant if MongooseIM is [configured with an RDBMS backend](../advanced-configuration/database-backends-configuration.md), MAM metrics when [mod_mam is enabled](../modules/mod_mam.md) and MAM flush times when MAM is configured with an RDBMS backend with `async_writer` option (default).

#### Example graph in Grafana

![An example graph in Grafana](example-grafana-graph.png)

This screenshot shows a graph plotting the RDBMS simple query time metric mentioned above.
The graph is plotted for three nodes with each node having a different prefix: `mongoose.node1`, `mongoose.node2` and `mongoose.node3`.

The queries take metrics for all nodes and all domains (`**` is a wildcard for multiple parts of the metric name) and groups them *per-node*, *per-value-type* - respectively `1`st (indexed from `0`) and `-1`st (last) parts of the metric's name.

Because time-based metrics in MongooseIM are given in **microseconds**, to display understandable values in graph's legend the Y-axis unit has to be changed on the `Axes` tab.
